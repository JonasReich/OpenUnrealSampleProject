# Open Unreal Utilities Sample Project

This is a sample project for the Open Unreal Utilities plugin for Unreal Engine 4.
Please check the [plugin folder itself](Plugins/OpenUnrealUtilities) for a more detailed documentation of the plugin itself.
The plugin source code is [hosted separately on github](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities). 

This repository just acts as a tool for making extensions to the Open Unreal Utilities plugin and has no real benefit to anyone
just looking to use the plugin in a different project.

The plugin as well as OpenUnrealAutomationTools are embedded as git submodules with references to the respective latest development branch.
This means the subrepos are not locked to a specific revision, but always the latest HEAD.
