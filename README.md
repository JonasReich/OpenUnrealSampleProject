# Open Unreal Sample Project

![Open Unreal Sample Project Logo](Resources/ous_wide.png)

This is a sample / integration project for all the Open Unreal ... plugins and tools:

- Unreal Plugins
    - [Open Unreal Utilities](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities)
    - [Open Unreal Utilities - Json Data Assets](https://github.com/JonasReich/OUUJsonDataAssets)
    - [Open Unreal Coding Standard](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealCodingStandard)
- Tools
    - [Open Unreal Automation Tools](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealAutomationTools)

The plugins and automation tools are all embedded as subrepos.

This repository just acts as a for hosting and modifying all these projects in a unified environment and help me during development to make sure the tools remain compatible. To anyone else they at least show how to embedd them in a lightweight project :)

The repo history was completely re-written in June 2022, because I swapped out the embedded 'subrepos' with the more commonly use 'submodules'
because I found it far easier to work with them, considering they have better tooling support (esp. GitHub & SourceTree).
