# Open Unreal Utilities Sample Project

This is a sample project for the [Open Unreal Utilities](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealUtilities) plugin for Unreal Engine and the Open [Unreal Automation Tools](https://github.com/JonasReich/OpenUnrealAutomationTools).

The plugin and automation tools are both embedded as subrepos.

This repository just acts as a for hosting and modifying both projects in a unified environment and help me during development to make sure the tools remain compatible. To anyone else they at least show how to embedd them in a lightweight project :)

The repo history was completely re-written in June 2022, because I swapped out the embedded 'subrepos' with the more commonly use 'submodules'
because I found it far easier to work with them, considering they have better tooling support (esp. GitHub & SourceTree).
